Usage:
	1. Get the sources to a local folder (download tree / git clone)
	
	2. Refresh the HebMorph dependency (HebMorph.csproj) to point to a local copy
	of http://github.com/synhershko/HebMorph
	
	3. Download a he-wiki dump (pages-articles.xml.bz2) from http://dumps.wikimedia.org/hewiki/
	
	4. Compile and run the application.
	
	5. Point at the hspell-data-files folder and at the he-wiki bz2 file you downloaded.
	Pick a destimation for the report XML.
	
	6. Check / uncheck the Compute Coverage checkbox (may take much longer if checked). It
	tells the application whether or not to count all the unique words in the corpus.
	
	7. Click Execute, and wait.
	
	8. Saving the report currently is a lengthy process, which isn't reflecting through
	the progress bar. Be patient...
